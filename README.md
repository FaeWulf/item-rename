# Item Rename Mod

## Description

The Item Rename mod for Fabric Modloader allows players to edit various properties of items in the game, such as their
name, lore, and enchantment glow. With support for color and formatting, you can personalize your items like a piece of
cake.

This mod is heavily inspired by the plugin: [EpicRename](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/epicrename.4341/)

Also you can use my tools to easily make your own custom name/lore: https://faewulf.xyz/projects/epicrename
